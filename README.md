# Project Name: Salary Calculator


## Description


This application provides a useful tool for employers to help calculate monthly costs. While it useful, it is limited to current employees. Future updates will provide the ability to remove employees and their salaries from this application.

The goal of this application is to create an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. This application was started by placing inputs that would collect the data of the employees, and storing that information for future use. A function was then created to gather the monthly salaries of the employees and add them together. Finally, a delete button was installed to remove employees from the webpage.


Some problems were encountered when appending the data to the DOM, and the headers of the table were being deleted. The problem was solved by appending new headers every time a new employee was added.
